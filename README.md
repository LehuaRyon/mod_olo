# MOD Online Ordering
A pizza restaurant ordering and review application built with Ruby on Rails.

## Description
This app was built for the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) Rails project and is meant to let users order or review pizzas of their choosing.  Users can signup, login, and logout as well as login and logout through Google.  Users can edit their login credentials and/or delete their accounts.  Once logged in, a user is shown only his or her pizza orders and reviews. Users can create new pizza orders, edit, and delete them. Users can also review certain pizzas they've tried, search throughout the orders list by purchaser's last name, and search throughout the pizzas list by pizza name.  Users are also capable of viewing all the reviews for a specific pizza or all the orders for a specific pizza.
